## System Design Overview

### Architecture

QCL POS is built using Laravel, a PHP framework. Laravel is designed to provide a rich set of features and tools.
It leverages Livewire, a library that allows for real-time, interactive updates to a web page. When you make changes to an order, for example, the changes are automatically reflected on the screen without the need for a page reload. This makes the user experience much more responsive and intuitive.

QCL POS is housed within a virtual machine (VM), which is a good solution for on-site deployment. By using a VM, you can run QCL POS on your own hardware without the need for additional hardware or software. A VM provides a self-contained environment that can be easily installed and managed. It also allows you to easily update and manage the software within the VM, without affecting the rest of your systems.

### System Users

The system is intended to be used by the following kinds of users:

1. **Administrator**: Has full control over the system and can perform any task. Can configure shops, products, staff members, and customers.

2. **Cashiers**: These users are responsible for processing orders and managing the day-to-day operations of the shop. They can create and edit orders as well as manage payment.

3. **Order Takers**: These users are responsible for getting orders from the customers. They can create orders, add products, and monitor the status of orders. Typical usage is through Tablet.

4. **Accountants**: These users are responsible for managing the financial aspects of the shops. They can view and manage payment records, generate reports, and perform other financial tasks.

5. **GRO (Guest Room Operator)**: These users are like cashiers.
