    [x] Average Order Value (AOV): Total revenue divided by the number of transactions.
    [x] Customer Count: Number of unique customers served.

        [ ] Top Performing vs. Underperforming Shops: Clearly highlight the best and worst-performing locations based on key metrics.
-   **Date Range & Filtering**:
    [ ] Ability to select and analyze data for specific time periods (today, yesterday, last week, last month, custom ranges).
    [ ] Option to filter data by individual shop.

**II. Sales & Order Management**

-   **Critical System Errors**: Notifications about any technical problems with the POS system.

**VII. Customization & Reporting**

-   **Customizable Dashboard Layout**: Allow users to arrange and prioritize the widgets they find most important.
-   **Report Generation**: Option to generate detailed reports on various aspects of the business (sales, inventory, customer data) for specific periods and across selected locations.
-   **Data Export**: Ability to export data in various formats (CSV, Excel).

**Key Considerations for a Multi-Shop Dashboard**:

-   **Role-Based Access Control**: Different users (e.g., general managers, regional managers, owners) will need access to different levels of information.
-   **Scalability**: The dashboard should be able to handle data from a growing number of locations.
-   **Real-time Updates**: Key metrics should be updated frequently to provide an accurate snapshot of the current situation.
-   **User-Friendly Interface**: The dashboard should be intuitive and easy to navigate, even with a large amount of data.
